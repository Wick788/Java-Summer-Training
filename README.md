## 🌟 Featured Project: Student Management System

A complete Java Swing application for managing student records with the following features:

- Add, update, and delete student records
- Search functionality
- Tabular display of student data
- Persistent data storage
- Form validation

### Components:
- Student.java: Student entity class
- StudentDAO.java: Data Access Object for CRUD operations
- StudentManagementSystem.java: Main GUI application

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Any Java IDE (VS Code, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA)

### Running the Examples

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE
3. Navigate to the specific example you want to run
4. Run the main class

For example, to run the Student Management System:

```
cd Chapter_08_Mini_Projects/StudentManagementSystem
javac StudentManagementSystem.java
java StudentManagementSystem
```

## 📝 Learning Path

For beginners, we recommend following the chapters in order:

1. Start with Java fundamentals to understand basic syntax
2. Move to OOP concepts for structured programming
3. Learn exception handling for robust code
4. Explore multithreading for concurrent programming
5. Study AWT and Swing for desktop application development
6. Examine applets and servlets for web components
7. Complete mini-projects to apply all concepts together
